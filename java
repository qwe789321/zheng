Here I share my experiences and notes when learning java,which is convenient for me to check later.
1、The core of java is the JVM,java virtual machine,which is the real place to run java.
2、Core class libray:aprogram written by java itself,which can be called by aprogram that runs by itself.
3、JRE:(JVM,core class library)the running environment of java.
4、Java development kit:JDK.
5、The basic syntax of java is a bit like the c language.
